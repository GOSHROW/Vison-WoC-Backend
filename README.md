# Vison-WoC-Backend

Repository for Vison Backened for Winter of Code 2019.

There are two major components of VISON's backend:

1. Crawler: A crawler is a Search Engine bot or a Search Engine spider that travels all around the web looking out for new pages ready to be indexed. To use our experimental crawler click [here](https://github.com/thecodefoundation/Vison-WoC-Backend/blob/master/crawler/vison/README.md).

2. Indexer: Once the Search Engines crawls the web and comes across the new pages, it then indexes or stores the information in its giant database categorically. To use our experimental indexer click [here](https://github.com/thecodefoundation/Vison-WoC-Backend/blob/master/indexer/README.md).
